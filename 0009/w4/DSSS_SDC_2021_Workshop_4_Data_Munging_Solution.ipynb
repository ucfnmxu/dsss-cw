    "\n",
    "One of the first things that we do when working with any new data set is to familiarise ourselves with it. There are a _huge_ number of ways to do this, but there are no shortcuts to:\n",
    "* Reading about the data (how it was collected, what the sample size was, etc.)\n",
    "* Reviewing any accompanying metadata (data about the data, column specs, etc.)\n",
    "* Looking at the data itself at the row- and column-levels\n",
    "* Producing descriptive statistics \n",
    "* Visualising the data using plots \n",
    "In fact, you should use _all_ of these together to really understand where the data came from, how it was handled, and whether there are gaps or other problems. If you're wondering which comes first, I've always liked this approach: _start with a chart_. We're _not_ going to do that here because, first, I want you to get a handle on pandas itself!"

    "## Pandas with Weather API Data \n",
    "\n",
    "The UK's Met Office is a world-leading weather and climate research centre, and even if it doesn't always seem like their forecasts are very accurate that's because Britain's weather is inherently _unpredictable_. They've also done a lot of work to make their weather data widely available to people like us.\n",
    "\n",
    "I probably don't need to say a _lot_ about weather data because you've probably been making use of forecasts for much of your life! But it's _still_ worth understanding something about how weather data is gathered and reported: many organisations operate weather stations where data on wind speed, temperature, rain, and amount of sun are collected and then transmitted to a server to be integrated into a larger data set of weather _observations_ at a national or global scale. Of course, any _one_ station might be in the 'wrong' place (somewhere shady or protected from the rain) or it might even break down, but the idea is that if you have enough of them you can collect a pretty good range of data for the country and begin to look for patterns and, potentially, make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be accessing data from the MetOffice from weather stations where observations, such as the ones below, are collected:\n",
    "* <Param name=\"F\" units=\"C\">Feels Like Temperature (units: degrees Celsius)\n",
    "* <Param name=\"G\" units=\"mph\">Wind Gust (units: mph)</Param>\n",
    "* <Param name=\"H\" units=\"%\">Screen Relative Humidity (units: percent)</Param> \n",
    "* <Param name=\"T\" units=\"C\">Temperature (units: degrees Celsius)</Param> \n",
    "* <Param name=\"V\" units=\"\">Visibility (units: km?)</Param> \n",
    "* <Param name=\"D\" units=\"compass\">Wind Direction (units: compass degrees)</Param>  \n",
    "* <Param name=\"S\" units=\"mph\">Wind Speed (units: mph)</Param> \n",
    "* <Param name=\"U\" units=\"\">Max UV Index (units: index value)</Param> \n",
    "* <Param name=\"W\" units=\"\">Weather Type (units: categorical)</Param> \n",
    "* <Param name=\"Pp\" units=\"%\">Precipitation Probability (units: percent)</Param>\n",
    "\n",
    "These observations are associated with a particular station (where did we see these values/where _will_ we see these values?), they will also be associated with _either_ a particular time in the past (when were they collected?) or, if they're forecasts, with a particular time in the future (when do we expect to see them?). \n",
    "\n",
    "So although weather data might seem more 'objective' than data on social class (though for obvious reasons it turns out that both are just attempts to capture data about reality, not reality itself), it may also turn out to be very complex to store and manage beccause of the temporal element _and_ the fact that it's not just a count of one thing, each of these observations uses a very different set of units.\n",
    "\n",
    "To really get to grips with the MetOffice API you will need to RTM (Read The Manual): https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/data/datapoint/api-reference. The ruder version of that, which you will sometimes see on StackOverflow and elsewhere, is: RTFM."

    "\n",
    "Because the weather is changing all the time, so is the data! And, 'worse', it's becoming obsolete: the forecast from 2 years ago isn't particularly useful to us now. *And* asking for \"yesterday's weather\" depends on the day that we're asking! When you have data that is always changing from minute to minute or day to day then you use an API (Application Programming Interface) to access it: the API knows that \"yesterday's weather\" means \"work out what day it is right now and then get the weather from the day before\", and it also knows that \"give me the current weather from station X\" means \"look up station X and find the latest weather report that I've received\". In other words, an API is  designed with programmatic, dynamic interaction in mind right from the start.\n",

    "This type of data requires a lot more research up front to work with, but it's very flexible once you know how to 'speak API' because you can _customise_ the API request so that the server responds with _only_ the data we're interested in instead of being 'stuck' with what the provider wants to give us.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Obtaining an API Key\n",

Look at the appendix to this notebook for more examples and options.\n",
